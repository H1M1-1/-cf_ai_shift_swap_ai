# ðŸŽ¬ Demo Instructions for Cloudflare Reviewers

## Quick Start (60 seconds)

### 1. Run the App
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Visit: http://localhost:8787

### 2. Select a User Profile

When the app loads, you'll see a **login screen**. Select any of the 6 pre-defined users:
- **Alice Johnson** (Nurse)
- **Bob Smith** (Doctor)
- **Carol Williams** (Instructor)
- **David Brown** (Nurse)
- **Emma Davis** (Receptionist)
- **Frank Miller** (Doctor)

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Select "Alice Johnson" for the best demo experience.

### 3. Explore Pre-Loaded Features

The app loads with **4 demo shifts** in October 2025.

**Dashboard Overview:**
1. See greeting: "Hi, [Your Name]! ðŸ‘‹"
2. **AI Chat Widget** â€” Natural language interface (primary feature!)
3. **Calendar** â€” Current month with demo shifts
4. **Coverage Trends** â€” Bar chart showing requests vs availability
5. **Recent Activity** â€” Live feed of shift posts

**Calendar View:**
1. Navigate to "All Shifts" in the left sidebar
2. Browse through months using â—€ â–¶ arrow buttons
3. Notice color coding: Your shifts (green) vs Others' shifts (gray)
4. Hover over any shift badge to see full details in a tooltip

### 4. Test AI Chat (Primary Feature)

**The AI understands natural language!** Try these examples:

```
"I need October 15th covered"
```

```
"I'm available Friday afternoon"
```

**What happens:**
1. AI extracts intent (seeking coverage vs offering availability)
2. Parses date/time information
3. Creates shift post automatically
4. **Finds matching candidates** (bidirectional matching)
5. Displays results in chat window

### 5. Test Bidirectional Matching

**Scenario:** The AI connects seekers with offerers automatically.

**Step 1:** Type "I need October 13th covered"
- Shift is created
- Calendar updates

**Step 2:** Click "Settings" â†’ "Switch User" â†’ Select different user
- Type "I'm available October 13th"
- **AI responds: "ðŸŽ‰ Found 1 person who needs coverage: [First User]!"**

âœ… This is the intelligent bidirectional matching in action!

---

## ðŸ§  How the AI Matching Works

**The AI uses bidirectional logic:**

### When You Request Coverage:
```
User: "I need October 15th covered"
    â†“
AI extracts: date=Oct 15, intent=seeking
    â†“
Creates shift post with note "Seeking coverage"
    â†“
Checks for users who offered availability around that date
    â†“
Displays matches if found
```

### When You Offer Availability:
```
User: "I'm available October 15th"
    â†“
AI extracts: date=Oct 15, intent=offering
    â†“
Creates shift post with note "Available to cover"
    â†“
Checks for users seeking coverage around that date
    â†“
Displays matches if found: "ðŸŽ‰ Found 1 person who needs coverage!"
```

### Matching Priorities:
1. **Exact date match** (highest priority)
2. **Same role** (e.g., both Nurses)
3. **Date proximity** (within 3 days)

---

## Expected AI Behavior Examples

### Example 1: Perfect Match
**Given:**
- Alice posts: "I need October 15th covered" (Nurse role)
- Bob posts: "I'm available October 15th" (Nurse role)

**Result:**
```
ðŸŽ¯ Perfect match! Same role (Nurse) and same date (2025-10-15)!
Would you like to cover this shift?
```

### Example 2: Close Proximity Match
**Given:**
- Alice posts: "I need October 15th covered"
- Bob posts: "I'm available October 13th"

**Result:**
```
Same role, 2 days apart
Would you like to cover this shift?
```

### Example 3: No Match
**Given:**
- Alice posts: "I'm available October 15th"
- No one is seeking coverage

**Result:**
```
Perfect! I've recorded that you're available to cover shifts on 2025-10-15.
When someone needs coverage for that time, they'll be matched with you!
```

## Architecture Verification

### Cloudflare Technologies Used

**Check these in the code:**

1. **Workers AI** (`src/index.ts`, lines 500-600)
   ```typescript
   // Used twice: once for intent classification, once for NLP extraction
   const response = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast', {
     messages: [
       { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
       { role: 'user', content: userMessage },
     ],
   });
   ```

2. **Durable Objects** (`src/index.ts`, lines 82-300)
   ```typescript
   export class ShiftRoom implements DurableObject {
     async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
       await this.initialize();
       // Persistent storage via this.state.storage
       // Stores all shift posts and matches
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Worker Routes** (`src/index.ts`, lines 310-850)
   ```typescript
   if (path === '/api/post') { /* Manual shift posting */ }
   if (path === '/api/list') { /* Get all shifts */ }
   if (path === '/api/intelligent-match') { /* AI chat + matching */ }
   if (path === '/api/clear') { /* Clear all data */ }
   ```

4. **Bindings** (`wrangler.toml`)
   ```toml
   [ai]
   binding = "AI"
   
   [[durable_objects.bindings]]
   name = "SHIFT_ROOM"
   class_name = "ShiftRoom"
   
   [vars]
   CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN = "*"
   ```

## Assignment Requirements Verification

### âœ… LLM Usage
- **Where:** `src/index.ts`, `/api/intelligent-match` endpoint
- **Model:** Llama 3.3 70B Instruct (fp8-fast) via Workers AI
- **Purpose:** 
  1. Classify user intent (seeking vs offering)
  2. Extract structured data from natural language
  3. Provide intelligent bidirectional matching
- **Calls:** 2 AI calls per request (intent + extraction)

### âœ… Workflow/State Management
- **Where:** `src/index.ts`, lines 82-300 (ShiftRoom Durable Object)
- **Storage:** Persistent via `this.state.storage`
- **Data:** All shift posts stored indefinitely
- **Coordination:** Single Durable Object instance coordinates all matching logic

### âœ… User Input (Multiple Methods)
- **Where:** `public/index.html`
- **Methods:**
  1. **AI Chat** (primary): Natural language text input
  2. **Voice Input**: Speech-to-text via Web Speech API
  3. **Traditional Form**: Manual entry in "New Shift" section
- **Inputs:** User context, role, date, time, notes

### âœ… Memory/Context
- **Where:** Durable Object + localStorage
- **Persistence:** 
  - Shift data survives Worker restarts (Durable Object)
  - User profile persists across sessions (localStorage)
- **Usage:** AI matching considers entire shift history

---

## Performance Expectations

### Response Times
- **POST /api/post:** 50-100ms (manual shift posting)
- **GET /api/list:** 20-50ms (fetch all shifts)
- **POST /api/intelligent-match:** 2-5 seconds (includes 2 AI calls)
- **POST /api/clear:** 50ms (clear all data)

### AI Model Details
- **Model:** `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast`
- **Temperature:** 0.3 (intent classification), 0.5 (data extraction)
- **Max Tokens:** 200 (intent), 400 (extraction)
- **Output:** JSON with structured shift data
- **Timeout:** 30 seconds (frontend timeout)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Chat messages not displaying
**Cause:** Function name collision (fixed in v1.5+)
**Solution:** 
- Do a hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
- Check browser console for `[Chat]` log messages

### AI times out after 30 seconds
**Cause:** Workers AI service is busy
**Solution:** 
- Wait a moment and try again
- Use simpler request: "I need Friday covered"
- Use manual form in "New Shift" section as fallback

### Calendar shows wrong year (October 2024)
**Cause:** Cached old version
**Solution:** 
- Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R
- Check code has `let dashboardMonth = new Date();` (not hardcoded)

### Durable Object not persisting
**Check:** `wrangler.toml` has correct migration:
```toml
[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_sqlite_classes = ["ShiftRoom"]
```

### Port 8787 already in use
**Solution:**
```bash
lsof -ti:8787 | xargs kill -9
# Then restart: npm run dev
```
